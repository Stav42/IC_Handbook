### 7805 IC Rating

Output voltage range = VMax=5.2V ,VMin=4.8V

Input voltage range = 7V - 35V 

Current rating of IC = 1A 

 ### Pin Diagram of 7805 IC
**INPUT** Pin 1 is the input Pin. A positive unregulated voltage is given as input to this pin.

**GROUND** Pin 2 is ground the Pin. It is common to both Input and Output.

**OUTPUT** Pin 3 is the output Pin. The output regulated 5V is taken at this pin of the IC.

As you may have noticed, there is a significant difference between the input voltage the output voltage of the voltage regulator. This difference between the input and output voltage is released as heat. So to disipate the heat and protect the instrument from malfunctioning, we have 2 options. Either design your circuit so that the input voltage going into the regulator is limited to 2-3 volts above the output regulated voltage or place an appropriate heat sink, that can efficiently dissipate heat.

### Applications of 7805 IC
 * Fixed-Output Regulator
 * Positive Regulator in Negative Configuration
 * Current Regulator
 * Reverse bias projection Circuit
