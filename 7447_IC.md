## 7447 IC
74LS47 is a BCD to 7-segment decoder/driver IC. It accepts a binary coded decimal as input and converts it into a pattern to drive a seven-segment for displaying digits 0 to 9. 0000=0, 0001=1,0010=2,……,1001=9. Binary coded decimal (BCD) is an encoding in which each digit of a number is represented by its own binary sequence (usually of four bits).

### Description

74LS47 IC accepts four lines of BCD (8421) input data at pins __A,B,C and D__ and generates their complements internally. The data is decoded with seven AND/OR gates to drive indicator LEDs of the seven segment directly. Display patterns for BCD input counts above nine are unique symbols to authenticate input conditions. 

 __LT'__ stands for Lamp Test. When LT' is low all the segments on the 7-seg display are lit regardless of A,B,C,D. 
 
__BI'__ stands for Blanking Input. When BI' is low the display is blank so all the segments on the 7 seg display are off regardless of A,B,C,D

__RBI'__ stands for Ripple Blanking Input. When RBI' is low and DCBA=0000 the display is blank otherwise the number is displayed on the display. This is used to remove leading zeroes from a number (e.g. display 89 instead of 089). To use with more than one display, connect __RBO'__(Ripple Blanking Output) from most significant 74xx47 to the __RBI'__ of the next 74xx47.

Connect __RBI'__ of the least significant 74xx47 to 5v unless you want the diplay to turn off when the number is 0.

Here the boxes represent 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 8 = 3 which is shown in the LED display.
