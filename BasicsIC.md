# Non programmable ICs

Integrated Circuits(IC) are the cornerstone of modern electronics. They are basically an arrangement of various electronics components like op-amps,resistors, transistors etc. They are used extensively. 




 
 ## Multiplexer
 A multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several digital input signals and directs it to a single output. A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output. A multiplexer is also called a data selector. Multiplexers are capable of handling both analog and digital applications. In analog applications, multiplexers are made up of of relays and transistor switches, whereas in digital applications, the multiplexers are built from standard logic gates. When the multiplexer is used for digital applications, it is called a digital multiplexer. Multiplexers are classified into four types:
 
 * 1.2-1 multiplexer ( 1select line)
 * 2.4-1 multiplexer (2 select lines)
 * 3.8-1 multiplexer(3 select lines)
 * 4.16-1 multiplexer (4 select lines)
