## 7447 IC
74LS47 is a BCD to 7-segment decoder/driver IC. It accepts a binary coded decimal as input and converts it into a pattern to drive a seven-segment for displaying digits 0 to 9. 0000=0, 0001=1,0010=2,……,1001=9. Binary coded decimal (BCD) is an encoding in which each digit of a number is represented by its own binary sequence (usually of four bits).

### Description
74LS47 IC accepts four lines of BCD (8421) input data and generates their complements internally. The data is decoded with seven AND/OR gates to drive indicator LEDs of the seven segment directly. The following picture clarifies the functioning a bit
