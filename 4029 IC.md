## 4029 IC

One of the most common requirements in digital equipment is counting. And the most
common counting requirement has to do with time. From a basic digital clock (which
is incorporated into most digitally-controlled appliances) to interval timers and event
counters, the need for counting circuits is very great.

The 4029 IC is a presettable up/down counter which counts in either binary or decade mode depending on the voltage
level applied at binary/decade input whenever a signal is recieved at the CLOCK. 

### Functioning
The pin connections are shown below

The internal schematic diagram of the 4029 is quite complex. However, we can’t reach the internal circuitry in any
case, so the functional diagram to the right is far more useful for our purposes.
Most of the designations are straightforward and intuitive.

__UP/DN__ 
Pin 10 tells the counter to count up if it is a logic 1, or down when it is logic 0

__BIN/DEC__
A logic 1 to the bin/dec input i.e Pin 9 causes the counter to operate in binary mode, while a logic 0 switches it to decimal (sometimes called decade) mode.

__CIN__
Pin 5. If CIN is logic 1, the counter won’t count at all. When CIN goes to logic 0, the counter operates normally.

__PE__
The PE input is the preset enable line. When this line is logic 0, the counter operates normally. However, when PE becomes logic 1, the logic signals present on the four jam input lines get copied directly to the four bits of the counter, overriding any prior count.

### Multiple 4029s
If multiple 4029s are cascaded for a larger count, all up/dn pins are connected together and driven from a common signal, as are all bin/dec lines. The CIN and COUT lines form the means of cascading counters and still keeping a fully synchronous count. 

If CIN is logic 1, the counter won’t count at all. When CIN goes to logic 0, the counter operates normally. Then, when the counter reaches its terminal count (9, 15, or 0 depending on the states of up/dn and bin/dec), COUT goes to logic 0. This is connected to the CIN line of the next IC to allow the next higher order of magnitude to count once. Then COUT goes to logic 1 again. 

The first counter IC in the set, representing the least significant digit, has its CIN line grounded to logic 0 so it will always count. The clock input, like up/dn and bin/dec, is fed to all 4029s in an extended counter circuit. This is the signal that represents whatever is to be counted. Any 4029 that is enabled by having its CIN line at logic 0 will change state to the next count when the clock rises from logic 0 to logic 1. Any changes to the CIN and COUT lines will occur just after that rising edge, and so will be ready for the next clock pulse.
